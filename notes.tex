\section{Introduction}
The purpose of these notes is to rigorously introduce a handful of
related core concepts that permeate mathematics.  The intended
audience is any undergraduate or accellerated high school student who
is familiar with the basic notation and concepts surrounding sets and
functions.  The student should also be somewhat comfortable with the
language involved in making and proving precise mathematical
statements; they should, for example, be able to explain the
difference between the sentences
\begin{quote}
  for all $x$, there is a $y$ such that $x+y=0$
\end{quote}
and
\begin{quote}
  there is $y$ such that, for all $x$, $x+y=0$.
\end{quote}

These notes will introduce the concepts of order, well-order, and
cardinality.  Order is what it sounds like: any way of comparing two
things that behaves as a comparison of size.  We draw attention to
some of the different kinds of orders and the axioms (rules) they
obey.  A particularly important type of order is a \emph{well-order}.
Well orders behave as the natural numbers do in that we can perform a
certain kind of induction them.  We then use the ideas surrounding
well-orders to prove \emph{Zorn's Theorem}, a broad and important
mathematical tool.  With all these concepts in our arsenal, we finally
turn to introduce the idea of \emph{cardinality}: the size of a
(possibly infinite) set.

\section{Order}
We want to study the idea of an order: a binary relation that behaves
as a comparison of size.  We approach this idea in three steps, each
of which is a useful concept in its own right.

\begin{definition}
  \label{def:preorder}
  Let \(X\) be a set and \(\leq\) a binary relation on \(X\).  Then
  \(\leq\) is a \emph{preorder} on \(X\) if it is reflexive and
  transitive.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}
  \label{def:partialorder}
  Let \(X\) be a set and \(\leq\) a preorder on \(X\).  Then \(\leq\)
  is a \emph{partial order} if it is also antisymmetric.
\end{definition}

Note that the only defect of a preorder that prevents it from being a
partial order is that it may be possible to have two elements \(a,b\)
in \(X\) with \(a \leq b\) and \(b \leq a\), but nevertheless \(a \neq
b\).  When \(\leq\) is a partial order, it is common to write \(a \sim
b\) to denote that \(a \leq b\) and \(b \leq a\).  We can also use \(a
\geq b\) as obvious shorthand for \(b \leq a\), and \(a < b\) as
shorthand for indicating simultaneously that \(a \leq b\) and \(a
\not\sim b\).

\begin{example}
  \label{example:prenotpartial}
  Consider the set
  \[X = \{\text{black}, \text{red}, \text{blue}\}\text{,}\]
  and the binary relation
  \begin{align*}
    \mathord{\leq} = \{
    &(\text{black}, \text{black}), \\
    &(\text{black}, \text{red}), \\
    &(\text{black}, \text{blue}), \\
    &(\text{red}, \text{red}), \\
    &(\text{red}, \text{blue}), \\
    &(\text{blue}, \text{red}), \\
    &(\text{blue}, \text{blue})
    \} \text{.}
  \end{align*}
  It is routine to check that \(\leq\) is a preorder.  It is not a
  partial order, however, because we have \(\text{red} \sim
  \text{blue}\); that is, \(\text{red} \leq \text{blue}\) and
  \(\text{blue} \leq \text{red}\).
\end{example}

\begin{example}
  \label{example:partialnotlinear}
  Consider the set
  \[X = \{\text{black}, \text{red}, \text{blue}\}\text{,}\]
  and the binary relation
  \begin{align*}
    \mathord{\leq} = \{
    &(\text{black}, \text{black}), \\
    &(\text{black}, \text{red}), \\
    &(\text{black}, \text{blue}), \\
    &(\text{red}, \text{red}), \\
    &(\text{blue}, \text{blue})
    \} \text{.}
  \end{align*}
  As in Example~\ref{example:prenotpartial}, it is routine to check
  that \(\leq\) is a preorder.  With our modification, however,
  \(\leq\) is also a partial order.  Note in particular the new
  behavior of red and blue: neither one is \(\leq\) the other.  We say
  that red and blue are \emph{incomparable}.
\end{example}

Our next concept is that of a \emph{total} (sometimes called
\emph{linear}) order.

\begin{definition}
  Let \(X\) be a set, and let \(\leq\) be a preorder on \(X\).  If
  there are no incomparable elements (that is, for all \(a\) and \(b\)
  in \(X\), either \(a \leq b\) or \(b \leq a\)), then we call
  \(\leq\) a \emph{total preorder}.  If \(\leq\) is additionally a
  partial order, we just call \(\leq\) a \emph{total order}.
\end{definition}

The usual orders on the real numbers and on the integers are examples
of total orders.

\subsection{Chains and Orders on Subsets}\label{section:chains}
TODO

\subsection{Well-Order}
Consider two examples of total orders: the real numbers and the
nonnegative integers, each with their usual orders.  There are many
differences between these orders, but one key difference is that it is
possible to define a function all the positive integers by simply
specifying how the value depends on the values the function takes on
lesser integers.  For example, consider the function \(f:\nnintegers
\to \integers\) defined by
\[ f(n) = 1+\sum_{k<n} f(k) \text{.} \]
We can make sense of this definition: \(f(0) = 1\) (since we interpret
an empty sum as having value 0), \(f(1) = 1+1 = 2\), \(f(3) = 1+1+2 =
4\), etc.  It is not possible to make sense of a definition like this
for the real numbers without resorting to calculus, but calculus
relies on properties beyond just the order itself.

The key property of the nonnegative integers that allows us to make
sense of the preceding definition is that the nonnegative integers
have are \emph{well-ordered}.
\begin{definition}
  Let \(X\) be a set, and let \(\leq\) be a total order on \(X\).  If
  every nonempty subset of \(X\) has a least element (that is, an
  element of the subset \(\leq\) all other elements of the subset),
  then we say that \(\leq\) is a \emph{well-order}.
\end{definition}

This property is equivalent to two other important properties.
\begin{definition}
  Let \(X\) be a set, and let \(\leq\) be a total order on \(X\).  Let
  \(P \subset X\), and think of \(P\) as a unary relation: that is, a
  property that may or may not hold of any individual element of
  \(X\).  Assume we know that, whenever \(x \in X\) is such that \(P\)
  holds of every \(y < x\), \(P\) in fact holds of \(x\).  In this
  case, we wish to conclude that \(P = X\), i.e.\ \(P\) holds of every
  \(x \in X\).  If this is true of \emph{every} \(P\) satisfying the
  stated assumption, then we say that \(\leq\) has the
  \emph{transfinite induction property}.
\end{definition}
\begin{definition}
  Let \(X\) be a set, and let \(\leq\) be a total order on \(X\).  We
  say that \(\leq\) \emph{admits an infinite descending sequence} if
  it is possible to find \(x_0, x_1, \ldots\) such that
  \[x_0 > x_1 > x_2 > \cdots \text{.}\]
\end{definition}
\begin{theorem}\label{theorem:wo-tfae}
  Let \(X\) be a set, and let \(\leq\) be a total order on \(X\).
  Then the following are equivalent:
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item\label{enum:wo-tfae-wo} \(\leq\) is a well-order,
    \item\label{enum:wo-tfae-ind} \(\leq\) has the transfinite induction property, and
    \item\label{enum:wo-tfae-desc} \(\leq\) does not admit an infinite descending sequence.
  \end{enumerate}
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
  It is sufficient to show that \ref{enum:wo-tfae-wo} implies
  \ref{enum:wo-tfae-ind}, \ref{enum:wo-tfae-ind} implies
  \ref{enum:wo-tfae-desc}, and \ref{enum:wo-tfae-desc} implies
  \ref{enum:wo-tfae-wo}.

  (\ref{enum:wo-tfae-wo} \(\implies\) \ref{enum:wo-tfae-ind}).  I will
  assume that \(\leq\) is a well-order that fails the transfinite
  induction property, and derive a contradiction.  Failing the
  transfinite induction property means that there is some \(P
  \subseteq X\), \(P \neq X\) such that, whenever we have \(x \in X\)
  with all \(y < x\) in \(P\), \(x \in P\).  Consider the complement
  of \(P\), that is, \(\setcomplement{P}\), the set of all points in
  \(X\) not in \(P\).  Since \(P \neq X\), we know that
  \(\setcomplement{P}\) is nonempty.  Since \(\leq\) is a well-order,
  take \(x\) the least element of \(\setcomplement{P}\).  Since \(x\)
  is least, we know that all \(y < x\) are in \(P\).  By our
  assumptions about \(P\), we can conclude that \(x \in P\),
  contradicting \(x \in \setcomplement{P}\).

  (\ref{enum:wo-tfae-ind} \(\implies\) \ref{enum:wo-tfae-desc}).  I
  will assume that \(\leq\) admits an infinite descending sequence,
  and show that \(\leq\) fails the transfinite induction property.
  Assume we have an infinite descending sequence
  \[x_0 > x_1 > x_2 > x_3 > \cdots \text{.}\]
  Define \(P\) to be the set of \(x\) \emph{not} in given descending
  sequence.  Let \(x \in X\) be arbitrary, and assume that, for all
  \(y < x\), \(y \in P\) (i.e., \(y\) is not in the descending
  sequence).  We know that \(x \in P\): if it were otherwise, \(x\)
  would actually be \(x_i\) for some \(i\).  Then we would have
  \(x_{i+1} < x\), and \(x_{i+1} \not\in P\), contradicting our
  assumption about \(x\).  On the other hand, we know that \(P \neq
  X\), so \(\leq\) fails the transfinite induction property.

  (\ref{enum:wo-tfae-desc} \(\implies\) \ref{enum:wo-tfae-wo}).  I
  will assume that \(\leq\) is not a well-order, and construct an
  infinite descending sequence.  Since \(\leq\) is not a well-order,
  take \(P \subseteq X\) nonempty with no least element.  I will
  construct an infinite descending sequence one element at a time.
  Since \(P\) is non-empty, set \(x_0\) to be any element of \(P\).
  We know \(x_0\) is not a least element of \(P\) (since \(P\) has no
  least element), so set \(x_1\) to be some element of \(P\) less than
  \(x_0\).  Similarly, \(x_1\) is not a least element of \(P\), so set
  \(x_2\) to be some element of \(P\) less than \(x_1\).  Repeat this
  process to obtain an infinite descending sequence.
\end{proof}

Note that the infinite descending sequence criterion is particularly
useful for determining whether an order is a well-order.
\begin{exercise}
  Show that any finite total order (that is, a total order on a finite
  set) is a well-order.
\end{exercise}
\begin{exercise}
  Show that the usual order on the integers is not a well-order.
\end{exercise}
\begin{exercise}
  Show that the usual order on the nonnegative integers is a
  well-order.  By convention, it is common to denote the nonnegative
  integers by \(\omega\) when we are treating them as a well-ordered
  set.
\end{exercise}
\begin{exercise}
  Let \(X\) be a set equipped with a well-order \(\leq\).  Consider a
  new set \(X+1\), which we define to be \(X\) together with a single
  new element we call \(\infty\).  Give \(X+1\) an order by using the
  original \(\leq\) on points from \(X\), together with the rule that
  \(\infty\) is greater than everything else.  Show that this process
  provides a well-order on \(X+1\).

  Note that Theorem~\ref{theorem:wo-tfae} tell us that \(X+1\) has the
  transfinite induction property.  If we consider the case where \(X =
  \omega\), we can perform this specific form of induction even though
  \(\omega+1\) contains an ``infinite'' element greater than every
  nonnegative integer.  This ability to reach beyond the integers is
  why we call this form of induction ``transfinite.''
\end{exercise}
\begin{exercise}
  Let \(X\) and \(Y\) be sets, let \(\leq\) be a well-order on \(Y\),
  and let \(f:X \to Y\) be an injection.  Show that the pullback of
  \(\leq\) by \(f\) is a well-order on \(X\).

  Note that, if we have a set \(X\), a well-order \(\leq\) on \(X\),
  and a subset \(A\) of \(X\), the inclusion map from \(A\) to \(X\)
  is an injection.  By this exercise, we know that \(\leq\) induces a
  well-order on \(A\).
\end{exercise}

\subsection{Comparison of Well-Orders}
Well-orders relate to each other in a particularly nice way: given any
two sets with well-orders on them, we can interpret one as an initial
segment of the other in a unique way.  In some sense, this fact means
that a well-ordered set doesn't contain any information beyond ``how
big'' it is, so it is common to think of a well-ordered set as a kind
of number.  We make these notions precise in this section.

\begin{definition}
  Let \(X\) and \(Y\) be sets equipped with well-orders.  We write \(X
  \orderembeds Y\) just if there is an order-preserving injection from
  \(X\) to \(Y\).  It is immediate that this is a preorder on the
  class of well-ordered sets.
\end{definition}
